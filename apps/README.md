# Apps

If you've ever worked on a Django project, this idea might seem familiar. Rather
than putting all like files into directories like:
```views/```
```models/```
```controllers/```
or something like that. Each piece of functionality acts as it's own self
contained app. And rather than having one large tests directory. With files that
cover everything in the entire system. Each app here has it's own ```tests/```
folder.
